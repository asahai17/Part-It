# part_it

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The Part-It App is a Flutter-based mobile application that allows users to view a list of events and provides detailed information about each event. This application was developed as an assignment task for The Internet Folks. It offers a user-friendly interface to browse through various events and stay updated on their details.

## Steps
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone (https://github.com/asahai17/Part-It.git)

Change your current directory to the cloned project folder:
```cd Part-It

Get the required Flutter dependencies:
```flutter pub get

Run the application on your preferred device (emulator or physical device) using the following command:
```flutter run

If everything is set up correctly, the application should now launch on your device, and you can start exploring the events.
